Exercise Notes

1.3  An HTTP request was processed and we were navigated to another page.  The button likely exists as HTML, while the actions regarding it are processed in the controller.
1.5  I'm not sure how to word it technically, but we navigated manually rather than relying on the routing through the controller.

2.1  The part of the controller that actually generates the page is a method called Contact().
2.2  "Your contact page", a string for general display purposes.
2.4  All files are simple names that correlate directly with the page they display, and they are contained in a folder that corresponds to the controller (Home -> HomeController).  Contact.cshtml displays the Contact page, Index.cshtml displays the Index page, and so on.
2.5  The data is displayed in the heading 1 and heading 2 tags as shown below:
<h2>@ViewBag.Title.</h2>
<h3>@ViewBag.Message</h3>

3.3  A nice big error page, since now corresponding view currently exists for Person.
3.5  Now I see the page I'd expect, although it's pretty barren (by choice, for now).
3.8  Now I see the basic data I added (Name, DOB, Address) on the page, alongside what was already there.
